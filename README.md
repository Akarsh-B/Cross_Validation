# Cross_Validation

Description :-
------------
A Python program for calculating the Error Rates with change in training sample size and number of folds in K-fold cross validation using 1 Nearest Neighbour algorithm, without Scikit-Learn tools.

Packages Used :-
--------------
1. random
2. Numpy --v 1.6.14
3. Matplotlib --v 3.1.0

How to Run the program :-
----------------------
1. Place the file name mnsit.py in the same folder as the code. This will download the training and test datasets that are required.
2. Run the Python file mnist1NNdemo.py using any of the Python interpreter with Python version > 3 (3.6 or 3.7) [Command: python3 iris1NNboundary.py]
3. Examine the plots for Error rates vs change in training sample size and the plot of Error rate vs the number of folds(K-fold cross validation)
4. Matplotlib will plot two different plots. Close the plot after viewing to terminate the program
